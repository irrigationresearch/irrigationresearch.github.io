 <h4> Work: </h4>

"Irrigation is essential for land and water resource management, crucial for growing 40% of the world's food and responsible for up to 90% of global freshwater consumption. However, its role is often underestimated in Earth system models that examine climate interactions, crop growth, and water cycles, impacting our understanding and strategies for managing environmental and climate change. In June 2023, AGCI hosted a workshop titled "Irrigation in the Earth System," bringing together experts from various disciplines to discuss and advance irrigation modeling and research. The workshop aimed to foster a cross-disciplinary research community, summarize current knowledge, address pressing questions in the field, and explore new modeling techniques and data integration. Participants discussed various uncertainties in irrigation models, such as water supply limits and crop water use efficiency under changing conditions, emphasizing the need for improved data and methods. A public panel, "Irrigation Re-Imagined," was held concurrently, discussing regenerative irrigation strategies to enhance resilience in agriculture. The workshop highlighted the importance of integrating social science approaches and leveraging high-resolution remote sensing data to improve model accuracy and utility. Discussions also covered the sociohydrological impacts of irrigation, including its effects on human health and climate justice. The event underscored the value of interdisciplinary collaboration and communication to innovate and enhance understanding of irrigationâ€™s role in the Earth system. Moving forward, the workshop has inspired various research initiatives and proposals, aiming to bridge knowledge gaps and foster sustainable practices.
