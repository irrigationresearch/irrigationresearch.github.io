"Irrigation is a critical component of land and water resource management. It is used to grow nearly 40 percent of the world’s food supply and accounts for about 70 percent of freshwater withdrawals and 84 to 90 percent of annual global freshwater consumption, largely for agriculture.

Yet irrigation remains largely underrepresented or nascent in Earth system models that represent different dimensions of the climate system, crop growth, nutrient cycling, or hydrology. This severely impedes our ability to capture important irrigation-Earth system interactions, with major implications for projecting regional environmental change, climate change adaptation and mitigation, and sustainable water resource planning.

In June 2023, AGCI hosted “Irrigation in the Earth System: Priorities for Data, Modeling, and Cross-disciplinary Research.” Participants included experts across the irrigation modeling and observations/data scientific communities, spanning researchers and practitioners working in climate, agriculture, and hydrology.
